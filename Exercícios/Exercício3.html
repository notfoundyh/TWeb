            <p>Fresh analysis of the bits of our moon, brought home by Apollo 17 astronauts, <br>
                 suggested our moon is 40 million years older than we previously thought.<br>
     That suggests the moon is 4.46 billion years old, rather than 4.52 billion years old <br>
     as previously estimated. The scientists behind the analysis say a more precise <br>
     age helps us better understand the history and evolution of the moon,<br>
      as well as Earth. "Without the moon, life on Earth would look different, <br>
      " study co-author Philipp Heck, a professor at the University of Chicago, said in a statement.<br>
       "It's a part of our natural system that we want to better understand, and our study <br>
       provides a tiny puzzle piece in that whole picture."</p>
